## What is SplitBetter
SplitBetter is a mobile application designed to simplify and streamline **bill-splitting among groups of friends**, whether during trips, shared meals, or casual outings. The app provides an intuitive interface for tracking shared expenses, calculating who owes what, and settling balances efficiently.

## Problem Motivation

Splitting bills in a group can be a confusing and error-prone process. Whether on a trip or dining out, people often forget who paid for what, lose receipts, or feel uncomfortable reminding others to pay them back. Existing apps are either too complex or lack support for casual, real-life group dynamics.

**SplitBetter aims to fix this** by offering a lightweight, user-friendly solution for:
- Keeping track of shared expenses
- Managing group splits with minimal friction
- Clearly showing who owes whom in a transparent way

## Features

### 1. Easy Bill Splitting
SplitBetter allows users to easily divide expenses among group members, removing the hassle of manual calculations and ensuring fair contributions.

### 2. Activity-Based Tabs
Users can manage expenses across multiple activities (e.g., trips, meals, events) using separate tabs shown on the home screen. This helps keep spending organized and contextual.

### 3. Automated Bill Recognition
With built-in **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, users can scan receipts to automatically detect items and split costs efficiently, making bill entry fast and effortless.

### 4. Real-Time Foreign Currency Conversion
When traveling abroad, expenses can be recorded in different currencies, and SplitBetter will handle the conversion in real time to ensure accurate and fair splits.

### 5. Debt Settlement Summary
A dedicated summary page provides a clear breakdown of how much each user owes to others. Users can also send payment reminders or notifications directly through the app.

### 6. Personal Expense Tracking & Budgeting
Beyond group expenses, users can monitor their **personal spending** and set budgets to better manage their own finances.

## Design and Plan

- We used Firebase for implementing secure user authentication, allowing users to sign up and log in using their email and password.
- The app interface was built using React Native and styled with Tailwind CSS utilities, providing a clean and responsive user experience across different device sizes.
- For our next milestone, we plan to continue building the UI using React Native and incorporating the OCR technology into the app as we work toward completing a fully functional mobile app running on a simulator.
